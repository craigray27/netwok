The file graph is mainly about drawing pictures by MATLAB;
The file SIR IN WS, I performed how SIR model with stochastic probablity works on WS networks;
The file GraphEmbedding includes several methods(deep walk, line, node2vec, sdne, struct2vec) which transfer networks to vectors used for further works like the risk-preferring node.
